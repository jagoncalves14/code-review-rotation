# Understand the project

- Read the [README.md](mdc:README.md) file and understand the whole purpose of the app.
- Use only the technologies stated in [README.md](mdc:README.md)
- Understand how the project's Database is by readin [supabase-schema.sql](mdc:supabase-schema.sql) â€“ It's also done in Supabase, important to know.
- Do not use `n-` CSS classes that don't exist in `node_modules/@nordhealth/css/lib/nord.css`
- With Nuxt, avoid adding explicity imports as most things are already auto-imported. On a first try, do not import anything. Only import if we get Linting complaints.
